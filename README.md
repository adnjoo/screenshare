```

This runs the app with developer tools and hot reloading.

### Code Structure

- `src/main.js`: Main Electron process handling screen capture and recording
- `src/renderer/`: Frontend application files
- `src/renderer/renderer.js`: Main frontend logic and UI interactions

### Adding Features

The app is designed to be easily extensible. Key areas for enhancement:
- Audio recording integration
- Webcam overlay support
- Advanced editing features
- Cloud storage integration
- Real-time collaboration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
